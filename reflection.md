1. What is a web server?

A web server is an application or system that sends web content to users via the internet or an intranet.

2. How do users access resources from a web server?

Users access resources from a web server via an http request. When the correct site name and path are inputted in the search bar of an internet application, the user is directed to the resource they are in search of.

3. What are GET and POST?

GET and POST are Flask methods that allow for user-entered inputs to be included in web content. Used in forms, the GET method uses inputs from the URL entered by the user. The data, when the GET method is used, is exposed, which could prove problematic for sensitive information. This is where the POST method is useful. The POST method operates similarly to the GET method, but hides the data from the URL, which keeps the data in question more secure.
